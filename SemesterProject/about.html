            Mankind Forever first formed in a space between boredom and passion. Their first album “Songs For Someone”
            was as energetic and raw as their youth. A year later came their second album “Highs & Lows” — a mix of
            upbeat songs and dark, melancholic ballads, this album showcased their diverse writing ability.

            After taking a hiatus to work on solo projects, Cole & Nathan are writing together again and are based
            out of Dallas, TX. Their goal is to write music that is timeless and bursts genres.
        <p>
            Their sound is changing, but still encompasses the passionate mood and lyrical sophistication of the first
            two albums. Only this time, it’s filled with indie-pop synth, fuller arrangements, and even more melodic
            riffs that command your attention.
        </p>
            Mankind Forever returned in July 2019 with eclectic single “One Day We’ll Look Down On The World We
            Created”. Their eagerly anticipated album is planned to release later this summer.
