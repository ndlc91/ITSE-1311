    <p>Bear is my 1.5 year old Golden Retriever.  He is a big bundle of energy, never stops running around, and is the goofiest guy you'll ever meet.</p>

  <h2>What Bear means to Us</h2>
    <p>Bear is the first dog indoor dog that's been a part of my family.  Growing up, we had dogs but they were never allowed in the house.  <br> </p>

    <p>When me and my wife got married, we were excited about getting a dog once we got an apartment.  We got bear when he was a puppy, and although puppies can be challenging, he has made us so happy! <br></p>
