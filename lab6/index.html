            <h2>Nate's Pick of the Week</h2>
            <p>Happy monday, eaters! This week's theme is 'All About Greek!' Our pick of the week this week is <a
                    href="http://www.hedarys.com/">Hedary's</a>, a
                Mediterranean restaurant in Allen, TX. Set in a quaint house turned into a dining establishment, the
                atmosphere is cozy, the staff friendly, the prices low, and the food delicious!</p>

            <br>
            <p>Mediterranean food is often overlooked, but is delicious and perfect for a family style meal.
                Mediterranean style food features lots of fresh veggies and tasty meats. Lamb is a staple of
                Mediterranean food, as well as kabobs, hummus, falafal, grape leaves, and rice. At most Mediterranean
                restaurants, there are usually tons of options, so there will be something for everyone, and it's a
                great choice when going with a group of friends.</p>

            <p>Hedary's is family owned, and the family are veterans of the restaurant business. On their website, they
                feature a whole section that showcases retro black and white photos of them as children in the 70's
                working in their family's old Lebanese Pizza shop.Prices at Hedary's are not the cheapest we've ever
                featured, but the portion sizes more than make up for
                the slightly higher prices. Most plates run between $10-$15 dollars, with some more affordable lunch
                options. Hedary's is also a BYOB restaurant, with a small uncorking fee, so you won't have the extra
                cost of drinks at this restaurant.</p>

            <p>One of the easiest, most delicious greek recipes you can make is Greek salad. It only requires a few
                ingredients, and you can easily put your own spin on it by adding additional veggies or meat.</p>
